## IP address of master SDRLab: RP address or 'localhost' if emulating a local server.
## UNCOMMENT ONE OF THE LINES BELOW.
#
#ip_address = "localhost"
#ip_address = "192.168.1.189"

## Master port: always 11111 for now
port = 11111

## IP addresses of follower SDRLabs, if any; must be in a list
#
# ip_addresses_follow = ["192.168.1.190", "192.168.1.191", "192.168.1.192"]

## Ports of follower SDRLabs, if any; must be in a list of the same
## length as follower IP addresses.
#
# ports_follow = [11111, 11111, 11111]

## FPGA clock frequency of master: uncomment one of the below to configure various
## system behaviour. Right now only 122.88 is supported.
##
## Clocks of followers are assumed to be in phase with master clock.
#
#fpga_clk_freq_MHz = 122.88 # RP-122
#fpga_clk_freq_MHz = 125.0 # RP-125

## Gradient board: uncomment one of the below to configure the
## gradient data format.  Note that gradient boards run by followers
## are assumed to be the same as the master's gradient board;
## different gradient boards are unsupported for now.
#
#grad_board = "gpa-fhdo"
#grad_board = "ocra1"

## GPA-FHDO current per volt setting (determined by resistors)
## (assumed the same for follower GPA-FHDOs as well)
#
gpa_fhdo_current_per_volt = 2.5

## Flocra-pulseq path, for use of the flocra-pulseq library (optional).
## Uncomment the lines below and adjust the path to suit your
## flocra-pulseq location.
#import sys
#sys.path.append('/home/vlad/Documents/mri/flocra-pulseq')
